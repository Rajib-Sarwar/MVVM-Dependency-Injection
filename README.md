# MVVM-Dependency-Injection
Iâ€™ve tried MVVM architecture along with Dependency Injection. I use MVVM, practiced different ways of implementing MVVM (Protocol-Delegate, Closure, Property Observers (Box Technique), FRP - Rx, Combine), good and bad practices for MVVM, Unit Testing, Code Coverage, Segregation of Entities, Sample Project and everything else that you should know about MVVM.
